# Goal 

Create a smart contract in which user can deposit ether and get ERC-20 tokens 

It's unidirectional and ERC-20 tokens can not be used to buy other ERC-20 tokens 

Ether -> ERC-20 only 

Store orders on chain. This is not common anymore because if the orderbook is visible other people can frontrun you. 

This is more for learning. 

## Orders 

There will (buy, sell) orders

1. Limit order 
2. Market order
